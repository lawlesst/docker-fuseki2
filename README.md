# docker-fuseki2 â€” Docker image for Jena Fuseki2

This is forked from Rurik Grinwall's [docker-fuseki2]((https://github.com/brinxmat/docker-fuseki2/)) project.

Changes/differences and goals:

 - use a released version of Fueski rather than build from source
 - use a minimal [java base image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/java/)
 - use with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
 - support configurations
